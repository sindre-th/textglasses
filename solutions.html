			<h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution is a pair of glasses that hears for you and presents the conversation inside the glasses for you to read. Inside these glasses there is an enhanced hearing aid, that will listen and “hear” a lot better than the persons hearing already are. In this way conversations will get easier and go smoother.</p>
<p>The glasses focus its hearing towards where you look, in this way other sounds around you will not interrupt you and the text that appears inside the glasses.</p>

<p>This new piece of technology will help people in many ways, grandparents who struggling hearing their grandchildren when visiting, and for example students with bad hearing will understand lecturers better.</p>
